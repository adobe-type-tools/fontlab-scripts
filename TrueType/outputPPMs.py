Output PPMs

This script will write (or overwrite) a `ppms` file in the same directory
as the opened VFB file. This `ppms` file contains the TrueType stem values
and the ppm values at which the pixel jumps occur. These values can later
be edited as the `ppms` file is used as part of the conversion process.

==================================================
Versions:

v1.0 - Mar 27 2015 - First public release.
